JustPick - a web application will allow individuals to form teams, set times and find locations to play.

Creating a pick up game, for any sport, is difficult to orchestrate and requires one to personally know a lot of individuals that are interested in the same sport as them. This requires several people to find a mutually agreeable time and location to play games. Some people do not have the time to commit to a league and are only able to play every once in a while. 

As an athlete, I want to provide other athletes with the ability to easily organize pick up games for any sport, so athletes can connect with other athletes in their area.
I also want to give other athletes a chance to feel like they are actually playing for something important and not just playing for fun.
